A collection of small helper routines that I found myself continuously
re-creating in new projects.

This repository forms a simple submodule that can be included in other
projects.

To use this, ensure that the normal steps have been taken to make a "lib"
dir:
    use File::Spec;

    # allow the libs to be in the bin dir
    use FindBin;
    use lib File::Spec->catdir($FindBin::RealBin,"lib");

Then add this repo as a submodule:

    git submodule add $REPOURL lib/HC
